				<p>What is <strong>Ticky</strong>Bot</p>
				<div>
					<p>
						TickyBot is a Slack Bot ü§ñ that lets you use support tickets on
						Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to
						assist your users, if you don't feel like it.
					</p>
					<p>
						With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets,
						change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly
						update itself on our site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct
						messages.
